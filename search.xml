        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While some cultures and countries, such as Japan, do rebuild their historic monuments anew in the style of the past, they prioritize the endurance of the craft over the permanence of the material and have regulated the techniques for such reconstructions. </p><blockquote><p>anew adv. 重新<br>prioritize a over b a的优先级胜于b<br>craft 工艺</p></blockquote><p>Western culture typically places greater value on the original material, which is why people pay hundreds of millions of dollars for an authentic da Vinci rather than a good copy of the Mona Lisa.</p><blockquote><p>place value on sth. = focus sth.<br>authentic 真品的 真实可信的</p></blockquote><p>Concerning Notre Dame, we must preserve its past as it is to carry its value forward transparently to the future.</p><blockquote><p>transparently 透明地</p></blockquote><p>The 1964 “Venice Charter,” devised by the International Council on Monuments and Sites, established guidelines for conservation and restoration, asserting, “The intention in conserving and restoring monuments is to safeguard them no less as works of art than as historical evidence. … Replacements of missing parts must integrate harmoniously with the whole, but at the same time must be distinguishable from the<br>original so that restoration does not falsify the artistic or historic evidence.”</p><blockquote><p>devise 倡议<br>no less as … than as … 既..又…<br>integrate with… </p></blockquote><p>Thus, if the spire is to be replaced, it should be built in a contemporary style that both harmonizes with the extant monument and also clearly distinguishes itself as a product of our time. </p><blockquote><p>contemporary 现代的</p></blockquote><p>And so, yes, such a position might translate into an architectural competition among the greatest architects of today — why not Rem Koolhaas, Kengo Kuma or Jean Nouvel — to create a spire that would at once acknowledge the past in respecting the proportions and style of Notre Dame while also articulating our own way of doing things? </p><blockquote><p>translate into 意味着 mean<br>articulate 发生 表达</p></blockquote><p>This may sound radical, but it would offer greater transparency and, therefore, greater value, to every period of history that the monument embodies.</p><blockquote><p>radical 激进<br>transparency 透明性<br>embody 体现</p></blockquote><p>Fortunately for the nostalgic, there are many examples of the 19th-century Notre Dame — a model of the building in 1843 is displayed in the Museum of French Monuments at the Trocadero in Paris, millions of photographs exist in books and online, and it could be re-created and experienced using augmented- and virtual-reality technology.</p><blockquote><p>nostalgic 怀旧派的<br>augmented-reality 现实增强<br>virtual-reality 虚拟现实</p></blockquote><p>But there is no sense in rebuilding its earlier history in the 21st century, when what we prize about Notre Dame’s history is that what is there really was made in a different cultural milieu.</p><blockquote><p>milieu 氛围 文化环境</p></blockquote><p>Complicating the forthcoming restoration, however, is the fact that Notre Dame is a living, breathing, functioning monument that requires constant maintenance, even under ordinary circumstances. </p><blockquote><p>forthcoming 即将到来的</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, on a daily basis, Notre Dame receives up to 50,000 visitors from all over the world, while also being an integral part of the city of Paris and its inhabitants that holdsdaily services for Catholics.</p><blockquote><p>an integral part of …不可分割的一部分</p></blockquote><p>Before the fire, the way the building was being used did not work well for anyone; an unending stream of tourists was funneled through the outer aisles (in fact, I used to call it the “discothèque”because of the close quarters, dark interior and all the blinking lights from camera flashes), while the devout could sit in the nave near the altar, although the services were largely overwhelmed by the crowds around them.</p><blockquote><p>funnel 漏斗<br>aisles 游客通道<br>discotheque = disco<br>quarter = room<br>devout 虔诚的<br>altar 祭坛<br>be overwhelmed 被盖过</p></blockquote><p>Surely the heat and humidity generated by the crowds in the building were not good for the building’s structure, either. </p><p>So this moment could be the opportunity to reconcile the different needs of the devout and of the tourists in a better way.</p><blockquote><p>reconcile 调和</p></blockquote><p>As Notre Dame now benefits from a surplus of new funding for its restoration, those in charge must be careful not to change fundamental aspects of it.</p><p>The monument should remain a living part of the city and not become isolated from it by a barrier and tickets that would turn it into a museum. </p><p>Moreover, the restoration of Notre Dame must under no circumstances become an opportunity to impose a false history on the cathedral at the expense of what is extant. </p><p>Something along these lines recently played out at Chartres Cathedral, which sustained a decade of restoration that imposed a 21st-century interpretation of its pre-modern interior, at the loss of its many 13th-through 19th-century layers.</p><p>The Venice Charter clearly states that a unity of style is not the goal of a restoration — the past should not be fabricated to align with people’s imaginations or expectations of it.</p><p>This is what some call “creative iconoclasm.” Whatever is done should be easily identifiable as differentfrom the older parts and clearly documented as such to allow future generations to understand the past on their own terms. Notre Dame was the first building constructed entirely in the Gothic style without any significant interruptions, from 1160 to about 1340. It remains one of only a few extant monuments in Paris that display architecture and architectural sculpture from the 12th through the 14th centuries relatively unaltered and legible as such.</p><p>Its 19th-century restoration, limited mostly to the upper levels, parts of the exterior and the treasury, should be preserved as examples of that period’s values and practices. Because there are so few examples like Notre Dame left in the very city that generated this architecture in the Middle Ages, this particularly important and historic cultural and political capital, we must work to preserve its historical integrity while maintaining its functionality as much as possible. Never simple, the past is instead messy, complex, and difficult to understand and interpret. In<br>our drive to control an ever more unwieldy and unstable present, what will it take to preserve our past for the future?</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a id="more"></a><p>How to restore Notre Dame — without falsifying history</p><blockquote><p>falsify 篡改</p></blockquote><p>What has burned is now lost to the past and cannot be simply recovered or replicated. Any attempt to restore the structure must acknowledge that.</p><blockquote><p>replicate 复制</p></blockquote><p>After the devastating fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron promised to rebuild the church, a promise followed by an outpouring of pledges of money from private individuals and companies, in France and elsewhere. </p><blockquote><p>outpouring 迸发 喷涌<br>pledge: promise </p></blockquote><p>While long overdue and very welcome, it is also a reminder that it too often takes a catastrophic accident like this to elicit the funding to preserve artistic treasures like Notre Dame, a tendency that unfortunately makes such tragedies seem necessary to save historic monuments. </p><blockquote><p>long overdue 逾期过久<br>catastrophic 灾难性的<br>elicit 引出 引导出 </p><blockquote><p>elicit sth. form sb.<br>monument 纪念碑 纪念堂 历史遗迹</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Equally troubling is Macron’s intimation that we can just “rebuild” the church. </p><blockquote><p>intimation 暗示 迹象 宣示 官宣</p></blockquote><p>Such simplistic bravado speaks volumes about our own disposable culture, which apparently allows us to dispose of, recycle, replace or, indeed, clone anything. </p><blockquote><p>bravado 逞能<br>speaks volumes about 充分表明 不言自明<br>disposable 可丢弃的</p></blockquote><p>But what has burned at Notre Dame is now lost to history and cannot simply be recovered or replicated — any attempt to restore the structure must acknowledge that.</p><p>So, after the debris is cleared and the damage assessed, what is next? </p><blockquote><p>debry 废墟</p></blockquote><p>First, work must be done to arrest further degradation. </p><blockquote><p>arrest 阻止…发生<br>degradation 恶化</p></blockquote><p>The building was already undergoing urgent conservation, because the interventions of 19th-century restorers Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc and Jean Baptiste Lassus — including the spire they rebuilt — were causing damage. </p><blockquote><p>intervention 干涉</p></blockquote><p>The stones they had replaced in the walls and on the flying buttresses were also eroding at a faster pace than the 12th-century stones they had left in place, so the building’s structural integrity was compromised.</p><blockquote><p>flying buttress 飞浮壁<br>erode 侵蚀 损害<br>integrity 完整性<br>be compromised 妥协 打折扣</p></blockquote><p>In the short term, Notre Dame must be stabilized against further degradation, and a new roof will be required so that the stone vaults that cover the nave of the church do not remain exposed to the elements and susceptible to further degradation.</p><blockquote><p>vault 穹顶 保险库<br>nave 教堂正厅<br>the elements 天气 坏天气<br>susceptible 易感染的 易受影响的</p></blockquote><p>Only after this basic work is well underway should any consideration be given to replacing the 19th-century spire, which dramatically collapsed Monday. </p><p>The restoration ahead raises questions about what history to preserve. </p><p>The spire that stood on Notre Dame on Monday dated to 1859 and replaced a 13th-century spire that was dismantled in 1786.</p><blockquote><p>dismantle 拆除</p></blockquote><p>It was not a copy of the medieval spire, for which there were no extant plans.</p><blockquote><p>extant 尚存的</p></blockquote><p>Rather, this neo-Gothic fantasy’s artistic merit lay in its conveyance of 19th-century values concerning the unified French nation based on a rationalized form of medieval architecture.</p><blockquote><p>conveyance 承载</p></blockquote><p>While that design could be reproduced today, why should it?</p><p>This line of thought quickly spirals into endless possibilities for a Disney-like creative reconstruction of the past. </p><p>Should the 19th-century techniques that were employed to build it also be reproduced? If an earlier spire is to be re-created, why not make a spire truer to the first spire at Notre Dame? </p><p>Which of its nearly nine centuries should be privileged? What should be done about the fact that much of the original building was lost in the French Revolution?</p><p>Should its pre-revolutionary state be reconstituted, as well?  Should we also remove the electric lights in the building? </p><p>Any of these fantastic possibilities would constitute a false reproduction of history, for they would nevertheless be done with contemporary techniques and bear the date of the year in which they were made — presumably 2024, the time Macron has promised to complete the reconstruction.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a id="more"></a><p>Against Chill: Apathetic Music to Make Spreadsheets To</p><blockquote><p>chill-out music 放松情绪的音乐<br>chill 也是也是一种态度<br>apathetic 冷漠的，不关心的<br>spreadsheets 电子表格</p></blockquote><p>Last fall, the students in one of my writing classes alerted me to a<br>wildly popular YouTube channel, run by an organization called<br>Chillhop Music. </p><blockquote><p>alert me to 而非 introduce to me </p></blockquote><p>The channel’s description was gentle, unassuming:”We hope you enjoy these chill lofi hip hop tunes while studying / chilling / working,” it read. </p><blockquote><p>lofi low-Fidelity 低保真的</p></blockquote><p>More than 2.2 million people had subscribed; several thousand were listening at that moment.</p><p>We called up the channel on the classroom computer.</p><blockquote><p>call up 展示</p></blockquote><p>The video featured an animated raccoon wearing a peach hoodie and drinking a cup of coffee, in a dorm room strewn with generational signifiers: houseplants, seltzer, a turntable. Every once in a while, the raccoon started typing or casually flicked its tail. Benign electronic music played.</p><blockquote><p>feature 主演<br>animated raccoon 动画浣熊<br>be strewn with 散落着<br>seltzer seltzer 某旧式气泡矿泉水<br>turntable 唱片转盘<br>flick 弹<br>benign: gentle and kind</p></blockquote><p>I found that the song evaded precise description—perhaps by design—so I free-associated on my notepad: koi pond, medical-grade marijuana, boutique hotel, hot-stone massage, European airplane, cool dentist. </p><blockquote><p>evade 刻意回避<br>koi pond 锦鲤池子<br>marijuana 大麻<br>boutique hotel 精品酒店<br>massage 按摩<br>欧洲航班便宜且服务好</p></blockquote><p>These days, to describe someone as “chill” is to propose that they’re slightly apathetic, but in a delightfully easygoing way. </p><p>The rise of chill as an aspirational state suggests that perhaps the best thing to feel is not much at all. The song continued. Maybe it ended. I don’t know. “Do you enjoy this?” I asked my students.</p><blockquote><p>aspirational 有雄心壮志的；一种令人向往的</p></blockquote><p>They found the question silly if not fatuous—the music wasn’t really for liking, in the traditional sense.</p><blockquote><p>fatuous = silly</p></blockquote><p>The music wasn’t for anything. It merely existed to facilitate and sustain a mood, which in turn might enable a task: studying, folding laundry, making preadsheets, idly browsing the Internet.</p><p>Spotify presently classifies chill as a genre, and there are an incredible number of playlists devoted to insuring a chill experience.</p><blockquote><p>genre 类型题材（文学 绘画 艺术）</p></blockquote><p>Chill Hits. Chill Tracks. Chillin’ on a Dirt Road. Chill Vibes. Evening Chill. Chill as Folk. Pop Chillout. </p><p>Interestingly, as a musical ethos, chill has also eked its way onto the pop charts: SoundCloud rap, one of the most popular and lucrative genres of the decade, is marked by distortion, low fidelity, and a slurred vocal delivery that seems plainly indebted to anti-anxiety medication.</p><blockquote><p>ethos 理念<br>eke 增加；勉强维持<br>lucrative 赚钱的<br>distortion 扭曲变形<br>slurred 发音不清<br>indebted 欠…</p></blockquote><p>SoundCloud rap is hardly as limp or as purposefully benign as Chillhop’s study music, but the genres do share a sort of practiced nonchalance, a heavy dedication to chill.</p><blockquote><p>limp 柔软的<br>nonchalance 冷漠的</p></blockquote><p>Although I recognize the utility of listening to non-distracting study music, I nonetheless find it disheartening to see art being reconfigured, over and over again, as a tool for productivity—and then, when the work is finally done, as a tool for coming down from the work.</p><blockquote><p>disheartening 令人沮丧的</p></blockquote><p>It’s especially disconcerting to see the practice of active listening denigrated, dismissed, or ignored.</p><blockquote><p>disconcerting 令人不安的<br>denigrate 诋毁</p></blockquote><p>Background music is hardly a new development, but, previously, these sorts of experiences were mostly relegated to elevators and waiting rooms; now the groundless consumption of music has become omnipresent. </p><blockquote><p>be relegated to 被分配为<br>groundless 无理由地<br>omnipresent 无所不在的</p></blockquote><p>In a 2015 press release, Spotify declared itself “obsessed with figuring out how to bring music into every part of your life, wherever you are, whatever you’re doing, whatever your mood.”</p><blockquote><p>obsess 沉迷于</p></blockquote><p>The idea of purposeful listening—which is to say, merely listening—is becoming increasingly discordant with the way that music is sold to us.</p><blockquote><p>be discordant with 与…不一致 </p></blockquote><p>The German philosopher Josef Pieper, in his signal essay “Leisure: The Basis of Culture,” from 1952, quotes the poet and critic Charles Baudelaire: “One must work, if not from taste then at least from despair. For, to reduce everything to a single truth: work is less boring than pleasure.” </p><p>Pieper argues that Westerners in spiritual decline can’t “acquiesce to being,” but, instead, must “overwork as a means of self-escape, as a way of trying to justify our existence.”</p><blockquote><p>acquiesce 接受</p></blockquote><p>It makes sense that, in 2019, as we grow collectively more uncomfortable with our own quiet, inefficient sentience, we have also come to neglect the more contemplative pursuits, including mindful listening, listening for pleasure, listening to be challenged, and even listening to have a very good time while doing nothing else at all.</p><blockquote><p>sentience 感知能力<br>contemplative 深思的</p></blockquote>]]></content>
