        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a id="more"></a><p>Bartleby</p><p>Struggling with style</p><p>Modern dress codes are easier for men than for women</p><p>Summer’s arrival in the northern hemisphere brings with it a dilemma that plagues every office worker.</p><blockquote><p>hemisphere 半球<br>dilemma 困境；进退两难<br>plague n. 瘟疫； v. 使折磨，使苦恼</p></blockquote><p>What does a casual dress code mean in practice? The happy medium between looking like Kim Kardashian or Hagrid the giant is hard to pin down.</p><blockquote><p>Hagrid the giant 哈利波特里某不修边幅<br>pin down 定位</p></blockquote><p>Goldman Sachs has just implemented a “flexible dress code” although the executive memo noted gnomically that “casual dress is not appropriate every day”. </p><blockquote><p>implement 施行<br>executive memo 行政备忘录<br>gnomically 精辟地</p></blockquote><p>Besuited corporate clients might not take kindly to investment-banking advice offered by someone wearing a tank top and ripped jeans.</p><blockquote><p>besuited 穿西装的<br>take to 短时间内喜欢<br>tank top 背心<br>ripped jeans 破洞牛仔裤</p></blockquote><p>It makes sense that banking would be one of the last bastions to fall to the advance of casual workwear. </p><blockquote><p>bastion 堡垒</p></blockquote><p>You want the people who look after your money to appear sober and respectable. </p><blockquote><p>sober 严肃的 未醉酒吸毒的</p></blockquote><p>For similar reasons, bank headquarters have deliberately been built in a grandiose style to emphasise the institution’s financial solidity and historical roots.</p><blockquote><p>grandiose 宏大的；宏伟的</p></blockquote><p>Depositors might hesitate about handing over their savings to people working under a railway arch.</p><blockquote><p>arch 拱门</p></blockquote><p>For men, the move to casual dress seems entirely positive. Few people will mourn the demise of the tie, a functionally useless garment that constricted male necks for a century.</p><blockquote><p>mourn 哀悼<br>demise 消失，死亡<br>garment 衣物</p></blockquote><p>The tie’s origins date back to the 17th century, when mercenaries hired by Louis XIII of France wore a form of cravat.</p><blockquote><p>mercenary 雇佣兵， 惟利是图的<br>cravat 领巾</p></blockquote><p>The modern version of the tie emerged in the 1920s and was popularised by Britain’s Edward VIII who, when not flirting with the Nazis, developed the Windsor knot. </p><blockquote><p>flirt with 与 …调情</p></blockquote><p>It became standard office wear for the next six decades. In the 1990s ties started to go out of fashion because technology titans and hedge-fund managers refused to wear them—and were rich enough to ignore social convention. </p><blockquote><p>technology titan 科技巨头</p></blockquote><p>Once, when Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, was to meet a venture capitalist, he turned up wearing his pyjamas.</p><blockquote><p>pyjamas 睡衣</p></blockquote><p>The jacket, by contrast, is a much more useful garment, replete with pockets to house wallets, spectacle cases and travel passes (or, these days, mobile phones).</p><blockquote><p>house v. 装<br>replete with 充满；装满<br>repleted 吃饱喝足的<br>spectacle 眼镜盒</p></blockquote><p>So the default work garb for men, when meeting clients, is jacket, open-necked shirt and dark trousers (denim excluded).</p><blockquote><p>work garb 工作装<br>denim 牛仔裤</p></blockquote><p>On days without meetings, men can slob out in t-shirts (though not too garish) and jeans, and no one will think the worse of them. </p><blockquote><p>slob n. 懒汉 v.很懒的做某事<br>garish 花哨的</p></blockquote><p>Arriving in shorts or without socks is another matter entirely.<br>But dressing in the morning is quick and easy. Steve Jobs was famous for wearing the same outfit—black polo neck, jeans and trainers—every day.</p><blockquote><p>outfit 着装 尤其指全身</p></blockquote><p>But what works well for men does not translate as easily to women.</p><blockquote><p>好句我背</p></blockquote><p>Karl Stefanovic, an Australian television presenter, wore the same blue suit every day for a year and no one noticed. </p><p>By contrast, his female co-presenters received constant remarks on their appearance. </p><blockquote><p>constant 时常不断的</p></blockquote><p>Even the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, gets snarky comments when she wears the same clothes twice.</p><blockquote><p>snaky comment 尖酸的评论</p></blockquote><p>Women’s workwear seems to have become less formal over time. A survey by Euromonitor found that sales of women’s suits fell by 77% in America between 2007 and 2016.</p><p>But many women worry that they will be judged as unprofessional (unlike their male colleagues) if their clothes are deemed to be too scruffy, or too revealing. </p><blockquote><p>be deemed to 被视为<br>scruffy 破旧<br>revealing 暴露</p></blockquote><p>It can also be hard choosing clothes that are suitable for both indoors and out. Air-conditioning systems in offices are often designed to suit the male metabolic rate, which can cope with colder temperatures than the female body. </p><blockquote><p>metabolic 代谢的<br>cope with 适宜</p></blockquote><p>The result may be that women have to bring an extra layer to wear in the building.</p><p>As for formal meetings, while men have abandoned the tie, many women feel obliged to wear high heels. </p><blockquote><p>feel obliged to 必须要做某事</p></blockquote><p>These give some women a sense of empowerment and femininity (not to mention extra height). </p><blockquote><p>empowerment 使人有感到权力的过程<br>femininity 女性气息</p></blockquote><p>But in health terms, heels can seem like the Western equivalent of the ancient Chinese practice of foot-binding: bad for women’s feet, ankles and backs and designed to limit their mobility. </p><blockquote><p>in xxx terms 从xxx角度来看</p></blockquote><p>Britain’s Parliament held a debate after a woman was sent home from her job as a receptionist for refusing to wear high heels (it was inconclusive).</p><blockquote><p>Parliament 议会<br>receptionist 前台</p></blockquote><p>Companies understandably want workers who deal with the public to look respectable. </p><p>Workers shouldn’t wear clothes that wouldn’t be appropriate if visiting a prudish grandmother or a child’s teacher. </p><blockquote><p>过分规矩的</p></blockquote><p>And yet no one should be expected to turn up at the office as if dressed for a wedding. The most important item to bring to work is a dose of sartorial common sense.</p><blockquote><p>a dose of 一点点<br>sartorial 裁缝的</p></blockquote>]]></content>

As a superpower in global energy markets, however, it is barely an adolescent.</p><blockquote><p>adolescent 介于儿童与成人之间的青年人</p></blockquote><p>As recently as 2015 it was illegal to export oil. Within ten years the shale boom has transformed it into the world’s biggest producer of crude.</p><blockquote><p>shale 页岩</p></blockquote><p>No longer must it tiptoe around regimes whose policies it detests but whose oil it craves.</p><blockquote><p>tiptoe  n.脚趾尖；v. 踮着脚尖走路<br>regime 政权<br>detest 厌恶<br>crave 渴望</p></blockquote><p>President Donald Trump touts an age of “energy dominance”. </p><blockquote><p>tout v. 用令人生厌的持续的方式来试图让人们接受或购买某物</p></blockquote><p>He has put its burgeoning energy prowess to the test with sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. </p><blockquote><p>burgeon v. 发芽，萌发；某事物的发展迅速<br>prowess n. 高超的技艺；非凡的才能、专长<br>sanction n. 制裁</p></blockquote><p>But dreams of dominance are running into the realities of energy markets.</p><blockquote><p>run into 撞上 </p></blockquote><p>On April 22nd the American administration announced that no further waivers would be granted to countries importing oil from Iran. </p><blockquote><p>waive  v. 放弃<br>waiver也就是授予你豁免某项要求的文书</p></blockquote><p>“We are going to zero,” declared Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state.</p><p>Waivers to eight countries, granted in November, were due to expire on May 2nd. </p><p>Even so, investors were shocked that no exceptions were allowed. </p><p>According to the state department, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and America will help meet demand. </p><p>But Brent crude, the international benchmark, quickly topped $74, the highest level in nearly six months.</p><p>The Trump administration is right to make a fuss about America’s oil boom.</p><blockquote><p>make a fuss 对某人某事物过于注意；太把……当回事了</p></blockquote><p>According to the International Energy Agency, by 2021 the country may be a<br>net exporter of oil. This would be a stunning reversal. </p><blockquote><p>stunning adj. 了不起的；出色的；令人震惊的；重大的<br>reversal 逆转</p></blockquote><p>Not long ago, notes Amy Myers Jaffe of the Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank, oil imports were the largest cause of America’s current-account deficit.</p><p>But it is wrong to think it can bring about dramatic change in Iran and Venezuela without risking dramatic spikes in petrol prices. </p><p>America’s government does not control its oil industry. Oil firms are backed by investors whose interests do not necessarily align with those of the president. </p><p>Nor can it control the world’s many buyers and sellers of crude. American production accounts for about 15% of global output, a striking increase from what it was but still a small share of total supply. </p><blockquote><p>striking adj. 引人注目的</p></blockquote><p>Complicating matters, investors have struggled to anticipate the Trump administration’s actions. Rather than stabilise oil markets, America has been as likely to do the opposite.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a id="more"></a><p>The Sri Lankan government’s decision to block all social media sites in the wake of Sunday’s deadly attacks is emblematic of just how much US-based technology companies’ failure to rein in misinformation, extremism and incitement to violence has come to outweigh the claimed benefits of social media.</p><blockquote><p>emblematic 可当标志的<br>incitement 煽动</p></blockquote><p>Sri Lanka’s government moved to block Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram – all owned by Facebook – on Sunday out of concern that “false news reports … spreading through social media” could lead to violence. The services will be suspended until investigations into the blasts that killed more than 200 people are concluded, the government said. Non-Facebook social media services including YouTube and Viber have also been suspended, but Facebook and WhatsApp are the dominant platforms in the country.</p><p>For Facebook in particular, Sri Lanka’s decision represents a remarkable comedown from a time, less than three years ago, when Facebook was viewed as “one of the world’s most important emergency response institutions”, as Wired magazine wrote at the time.</p><p>The social network’s vast global scale, its intricate mapping of social relationships, its algorithmically triggered “safety check” product and its suite of tools enabling the rapid dissemination of information and live video were at the time viewed as a potential boon to global disaster response.</p><p>Survivors could use Facebook to mark themselves safe; governments could use Facebook to broadcast live updates; and NGOs and locals could use Facebook to coordinate relief efforts.</p><p>But the same features that make Facebook so useful have also made it incredibly dangerous: misinformation travels just as fast as verified information, if not faster.</p><p>Recent weeks have provided numerous examples of just how damaging that can be in the aftermath of a crisis. The Christchurch gunman who shot and killed 50 Muslim worshippers, used Facebook Live to broadcast his attack, effectively weaponizing the platform. Facebook and YouTube both failed to prevent the video from spreading.</p><p>Just this week, a YouTube feature designed to curb misinformation ended up creating it, when the platform appended a panel with information about the September 11 terrorist attacks to livestreams of the Notre Dame fire, creating the false impression that the fire was linked to terrorism</p><p>In Sri Lanka, misinformation spread through social media has been linked to deadly mob violence before. In March 2018, the government blocked Facebook, WhatsApp and other internet platforms amid hardline Buddhist violence against Muslims, some of it fuelled by hate speech and false rumors spread on social media. At the time, the Sri Lankan government harshly criticized Facebook for its failure to properly police hate speech in local languages.</p>]]></content>

After a long publicity hiatus, brought on by his self-imposed exile inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, Julian Assange has found his way back into the headlines. </p><blockquote><p>hiatus 间断 停滞<br>bring on 使发作 导致<br>exile 流放<br>has found his way back into 找出回…的路</p></blockquote><p>Whistleblowing has been growing in influence since the 1970s. </p><blockquote><p>水门 越战</p></blockquote><p>Yet over the past decade or more, Assange and the WikiLeaks organisation he founded, have turned whistleblowing into something akin to a career choice for some young adults.</p><blockquote><p>akin to 类似于</p></blockquote><p>WikiLeaks became famous - or infamous, depending on your worldview - for providing an unprecedented platform for people who wanted to leak sensitive secrets.</p><blockquote><p>infamous 臭名昭著<br>unprecedented 前所未有的<br>platform 平台</p></blockquote><p>Their work was glamorised by the publicity WikiLeaks generated.</p><blockquote><p>glamorised 美化</p></blockquote><p>Some commentators argue that Julian Assange and his colleagues are champions of free speech. Others see them as defenders of press freedom. </p><blockquote><p>champion 捍卫者</p></blockquote><p>Still others claim that the WikiLeaks crew are making a stand in support of the true culture of the internet and the world wide web. There are good reasons to be wary of all three arguments.</p><blockquote><p>make a stand 表达立场<br>be wary of 小心谨慎</p></blockquote><p>In any society, true freedom of speech requires that citizens take responsibility for what they say, or publish.</p><p>Acclaiming individual rights without recognising concomitant social responsibilities is the beginning of anarchism.</p><blockquote><p>concomitant 伴随的 附带的<br>anarchism 无政府主义</p></blockquote><p>This has been one of the arguments - a persuasive one, I think - for tighter regulation of social media companies.</p><p>They want the freedom to operate as news curators, while retaining a free-wheeling cowboy status when it comes to responsibility for the content of their sites. </p><blockquote><p>curator 博物馆长<br>free-wheeling 随心所欲的</p></blockquote><p>They cannot be allowed to have their proverbial profit cake while happily scoffing it down.</p><blockquote><p>proverbial 众所周知的<br>scoff 狼吞虎咽</p></blockquote><p>In the case of online publishing houses like WikiLeaks, publication of material is accompanied by claims to moral authority. This is arguably the highest form of authority.</p><p>To make a credible claim to it, publishers must be seen to be above reproach.</p><blockquote><p>reproach 责备 批评</p></blockquote><p>This means, among other things, that they must allow themselves to be measured by some yardstick beyond their own collective conscience. </p><blockquote><p>yardstick 衡量标准 准绳</p></blockquote><p>Julian Assange and his crew have demonstrated no accountability except to their own internal culture and their individual consciences. </p><blockquote><p>demostrated 证明<br>accountability 责任</p></blockquote><p>In this they have diluted any potential authority as a voice for free speech among the wider population, most members of which live not so much in subservience to but with respect for social structures.</p><blockquote><p>diluted 稀释 冲淡<br>subservience 有利于<br>not so much … but to 与其说 不如说</p></blockquote><p>WikiLeaks also likes to challenge systems of governance without offering any suggestions as to how they might be improved.</p><p>It attacks not just abuses of the system - as was the case during Watergate, for example - but the system itself. </p><p>In this it has possibly revealed itself to be more about cyber-anarchism than cyber-activism. </p><blockquote><p>cyber-… 网络xx主义</p></blockquote><p>Activists like to promote an alternative, improved view of society. Anarchists take no such pains; they seem more content to undermine the current system and hope that something better emerges after the revolution.</p><blockquote><p>take pains 小心翼翼<br>content 满足<br>undermine 破坏</p></blockquote><p>Julian Assange took to calling himself a journalist a few years ago. His spokespersons were throwing this epithet his way again today, as they spoke out against his arrest.</p><blockquote><p>take to doing 喜欢 …<br>epithet 别称 绰号 </p></blockquote><p>In the beginning, the WikiLeaks co-founder may have found the journalist label useful in establishing credibility.</p><p>“Computer hacker” doesn’t carry the same weight, after all, In recent years, Assange has used his aspirations to journalism as political coverage against espionage charges in the US, where freedom of the press is held in almost sacred regard. </p><blockquote><p>aspiration 渴望<br>coverage 掩护<br>espionage charge 间谍指控<br>sacred 神圣的</p></blockquote><p>Yet he seems ignorant of the fact that one key tenet of journalism is that reporters should never allow themselves to become the story.</p><blockquote><p>tenet 宗旨</p></blockquote><p>Now, as news organisations increasingly erect online paywalls and one-person cyber-jockeys cash in on clickbait advertising, purists see WikiLeaks as a body of crusaders for original web culture.</p><blockquote><p>cyber-jockey 网上上班的人<br>one-person cyber-jockeys 自媒体<br>purist 理想主义者<br>crusader 十字军战士</p></blockquote><p>Yet its most ardent supporters either can’t see or won’t acknowledge that by their actions groups like Wikileaks make the case for even higher levels of government internet regulation. </p><blockquote><p>ardent 激烈的<br>make the case for 为…提供理由</p></blockquote><p>This would be supported by many groups outside of government, including businesses who fear that WikiLeaks and its kind may turn on them next.</p><blockquote><p>outside of 美语之外 英语里“of”很少 </p></blockquote>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While some cultures and countries, such as Japan, do rebuild their historic monuments anew in the style of the past, they prioritize the endurance of the craft over the permanence of the material and have regulated the techniques for such reconstructions. </p><blockquote><p>anew adv. 重新<br>prioritize a over b a的优先级胜于b<br>craft 工艺</p></blockquote><p>Western culture typically places greater value on the original material, which is why people pay hundreds of millions of dollars for an authentic da Vinci rather than a good copy of the Mona Lisa.</p><blockquote><p>place value on sth. = focus sth.<br>authentic 真品的 真实可信的</p></blockquote><p>Concerning Notre Dame, we must preserve its past as it is to carry its value forward transparently to the future.</p><blockquote><p>transparently 透明地</p></blockquote><p>The 1964 “Venice Charter,” devised by the International Council on Monuments and Sites, established guidelines for conservation and restoration, asserting, “The intention in conserving and restoring monuments is to safeguard them no less as works of art than as historical evidence. … Replacements of missing parts must integrate harmoniously with the whole, but at the same time must be distinguishable from the<br>original so that restoration does not falsify the artistic or historic evidence.”</p><blockquote><p>devise 倡议<br>no less as … than as … 既..又…<br>integrate with… </p></blockquote><p>Thus, if the spire is to be replaced, it should be built in a contemporary style that both harmonizes with the extant monument and also clearly distinguishes itself as a product of our time. </p><blockquote><p>contemporary 现代的</p></blockquote><p>And so, yes, such a position might translate into an architectural competition among the greatest architects of today — why not Rem Koolhaas, Kengo Kuma or Jean Nouvel — to create a spire that would at once acknowledge the past in respecting the proportions and style of Notre Dame while also articulating our own way of doing things? </p><blockquote><p>translate into 意味着 mean<br>articulate 发生 表达</p></blockquote><p>This may sound radical, but it would offer greater transparency and, therefore, greater value, to every period of history that the monument embodies.</p><blockquote><p>radical 激进<br>transparency 透明性<br>embody 体现</p></blockquote><p>Fortunately for the nostalgic, there are many examples of the 19th-century Notre Dame — a model of the building in 1843 is displayed in the Museum of French Monuments at the Trocadero in Paris, millions of photographs exist in books and online, and it could be re-created and experienced using augmented- and virtual-reality technology.</p><blockquote><p>nostalgic 怀旧派的<br>augmented-reality 现实增强<br>virtual-reality 虚拟现实</p></blockquote><p>But there is no sense in rebuilding its earlier history in the 21st century, when what we prize about Notre Dame’s history is that what is there really was made in a different cultural milieu.</p><blockquote><p>milieu 氛围 文化环境</p></blockquote><p>Complicating the forthcoming restoration, however, is the fact that Notre Dame is a living, breathing, functioning monument that requires constant maintenance, even under ordinary circumstances. </p><blockquote><p>forthcoming 即将到来的</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, on a daily basis, Notre Dame receives up to 50,000 visitors from all over the world, while also being an integral part of the city of Paris and its inhabitants that holdsdaily services for Catholics.</p><blockquote><p>an integral part of …不可分割的一部分</p></blockquote><p>Before the fire, the way the building was being used did not work well for anyone; an unending stream of tourists was funneled through the outer aisles (in fact, I used to call it the “discothèque”because of the close quarters, dark interior and all the blinking lights from camera flashes), while the devout could sit in the nave near the altar, although the services were largely overwhelmed by the crowds around them.</p><blockquote><p>funnel 漏斗<br>aisles 游客通道<br>discotheque = disco<br>quarter = room<br>devout 虔诚的<br>altar 祭坛<br>be overwhelmed 被盖过</p></blockquote><p>Surely the heat and humidity generated by the crowds in the building were not good for the building’s structure, either. </p><p>So this moment could be the opportunity to reconcile the different needs of the devout and of the tourists in a better way.</p><blockquote><p>reconcile 调和</p></blockquote><p>As Notre Dame now benefits from a surplus of new funding for its restoration, those in charge must be careful not to change fundamental aspects of it.</p><p>The monument should remain a living part of the city and not become isolated from it by a barrier and tickets that would turn it into a museum. </p><p>Moreover, the restoration of Notre Dame must under no circumstances become an opportunity to impose a false history on the cathedral at the expense of what is extant. </p><p>Something along these lines recently played out at Chartres Cathedral, which sustained a decade of restoration that imposed a 21st-century interpretation of its pre-modern interior, at the loss of its many 13th-through 19th-century layers.</p><p>The Venice Charter clearly states that a unity of style is not the goal of a restoration — the past should not be fabricated to align with people’s imaginations or expectations of it.</p><p>This is what some call “creative iconoclasm.” Whatever is done should be easily identifiable as differentfrom the older parts and clearly documented as such to allow future generations to understand the past on their own terms. Notre Dame was the first building constructed entirely in the Gothic style without any significant interruptions, from 1160 to about 1340. It remains one of only a few extant monuments in Paris that display architecture and architectural sculpture from the 12th through the 14th centuries relatively unaltered and legible as such.</p><p>Its 19th-century restoration, limited mostly to the upper levels, parts of the exterior and the treasury, should be preserved as examples of that period’s values and practices. Because there are so few examples like Notre Dame left in the very city that generated this architecture in the Middle Ages, this particularly important and historic cultural and political capital, we must work to preserve its historical integrity while maintaining its functionality as much as possible. Never simple, the past is instead messy, complex, and difficult to understand and interpret. In<br>our drive to control an ever more unwieldy and unstable present, what will it take to preserve our past for the future?</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a id="more"></a><p>How to restore Notre Dame — without falsifying history</p><blockquote><p>falsify 篡改</p></blockquote><p>What has burned is now lost to the past and cannot be simply recovered or replicated. Any attempt to restore the structure must acknowledge that.</p><blockquote><p>replicate 复制</p></blockquote><p>After the devastating fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron promised to rebuild the church, a promise followed by an outpouring of pledges of money from private individuals and companies, in France and elsewhere. </p><blockquote><p>outpouring 迸发 喷涌<br>pledge: promise </p></blockquote><p>While long overdue and very welcome, it is also a reminder that it too often takes a catastrophic accident like this to elicit the funding to preserve artistic treasures like Notre Dame, a tendency that unfortunately makes such tragedies seem necessary to save historic monuments. </p><blockquote><p>long overdue 逾期过久<br>catastrophic 灾难性的<br>elicit 引出 引导出 </p><blockquote><p>elicit sth. form sb.</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>monument 纪念碑 纪念堂 历史遗迹</p></blockquote><p>Equally troubling is Macron’s intimation that we can just “rebuild” the church. </p><blockquote><p>intimation 暗示 迹象 宣示 官宣</p></blockquote><p>Such simplistic bravado speaks volumes about our own disposable culture, which apparently allows us to dispose of, recycle, replace or, indeed, clone anything. </p><blockquote><p>bravado 逞能<br>speaks volumes about 充分表明 不言自明<br>disposable 可丢弃的</p></blockquote><p>But what has burned at Notre Dame is now lost to history and cannot simply be recovered or replicated — any attempt to restore the structure must acknowledge that.</p><p>So, after the debris is cleared and the damage assessed, what is next? </p><blockquote><p>debry 废墟</p></blockquote><p>First, work must be done to arrest further degradation. </p><blockquote><p>arrest 阻止…发生<br>degradation 恶化</p></blockquote><p>The building was already undergoing urgent conservation, because the interventions of 19th-century restorers Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc and Jean Baptiste Lassus — including the spire they rebuilt — were causing damage. </p><blockquote><p>intervention 干涉</p></blockquote><p>The stones they had replaced in the walls and on the flying buttresses were also eroding at a faster pace than the 12th-century stones they had left in place, so the building’s structural integrity was compromised.</p><blockquote><p>flying buttress 飞浮壁<br>erode 侵蚀 损害<br>integrity 完整性<br>be compromised 妥协 打折扣</p></blockquote><p>In the short term, Notre Dame must be stabilized against further degradation, and a new roof will be required so that the stone vaults that cover the nave of the church do not remain exposed to the elements and susceptible to further degradation.</p><blockquote><p>vault 穹顶 保险库<br>nave 教堂正厅<br>the elements 天气 坏天气<br>susceptible 易感染的 易受影响的</p></blockquote><p>Only after this basic work is well underway should any consideration be given to replacing the 19th-century spire, which dramatically collapsed Monday. </p><p>The restoration ahead raises questions about what history to preserve. </p><p>The spire that stood on Notre Dame on Monday dated to 1859 and replaced a 13th-century spire that was dismantled in 1786.</p><blockquote><p>dismantle 拆除</p></blockquote><p>It was not a copy of the medieval spire, for which there were no extant plans.</p><blockquote><p>extant 尚存的</p></blockquote><p>Rather, this neo-Gothic fantasy’s artistic merit lay in its conveyance of 19th-century values concerning the unified French nation based on a rationalized form of medieval architecture.</p><blockquote><p>conveyance 承载</p></blockquote><p>While that design could be reproduced today, why should it?</p><p>This line of thought quickly spirals into endless possibilities for a Disney-like creative reconstruction of the past. </p><p>Should the 19th-century techniques that were employed to build it also be reproduced? If an earlier spire is to be re-created, why not make a spire truer to the first spire at Notre Dame? </p><p>Which of its nearly nine centuries should be privileged? What should be done about the fact that much of the original building was lost in the French Revolution?</p><p>Should its pre-revolutionary state be reconstituted, as well?  Should we also remove the electric lights in the building? </p><p>Any of these fantastic possibilities would constitute a false reproduction of history, for they would nevertheless be done with contemporary techniques and bear the date of the year in which they were made — presumably 2024, the time Macron has promised to complete the reconstruction.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a id="more"></a><p>Against Chill: Apathetic Music to Make Spreadsheets To</p><blockquote><p>chill-out music 放松情绪的音乐<br>chill 也是也是一种态度<br>apathetic 冷漠的，不关心的<br>spreadsheets 电子表格</p></blockquote><p>Last fall, the students in one of my writing classes alerted me to a<br>wildly popular YouTube channel, run by an organization called<br>Chillhop Music. </p><blockquote><p>alert me to 而非 introduce to me </p></blockquote><p>The channel’s description was gentle, unassuming:”We hope you enjoy these chill lofi hip hop tunes while studying / chilling / working,” it read. </p><blockquote><p>lofi low-Fidelity 低保真的</p></blockquote><p>More than 2.2 million people had subscribed; several thousand were listening at that moment.</p><p>We called up the channel on the classroom computer.</p><blockquote><p>call up 展示</p></blockquote><p>The video featured an animated raccoon wearing a peach hoodie and drinking a cup of coffee, in a dorm room strewn with generational signifiers: houseplants, seltzer, a turntable. Every once in a while, the raccoon started typing or casually flicked its tail. Benign electronic music played.</p><blockquote><p>feature 主演<br>animated raccoon 动画浣熊<br>be strewn with 散落着<br>seltzer seltzer 某旧式气泡矿泉水<br>turntable 唱片转盘<br>flick 弹<br>benign: gentle and kind</p></blockquote><p>I found that the song evaded precise description—perhaps by design—so I free-associated on my notepad: koi pond, medical-grade marijuana, boutique hotel, hot-stone massage, European airplane, cool dentist. </p><blockquote><p>evade 刻意回避<br>koi pond 锦鲤池子<br>marijuana 大麻<br>boutique hotel 精品酒店<br>massage 按摩<br>欧洲航班便宜且服务好</p></blockquote><p>These days, to describe someone as “chill” is to propose that they’re slightly apathetic, but in a delightfully easygoing way. </p><p>The rise of chill as an aspirational state suggests that perhaps the best thing to feel is not much at all. The song continued. Maybe it ended. I don’t know. “Do you enjoy this?” I asked my students.</p><blockquote><p>aspirational 有雄心壮志的；一种令人向往的</p></blockquote><p>They found the question silly if not fatuous—the music wasn’t really for liking, in the traditional sense.</p><blockquote><p>fatuous = silly</p></blockquote><p>The music wasn’t for anything. It merely existed to facilitate and sustain a mood, which in turn might enable a task: studying, folding laundry, making preadsheets, idly browsing the Internet.</p><p>Spotify presently classifies chill as a genre, and there are an incredible number of playlists devoted to insuring a chill experience.</p><blockquote><p>genre 类型题材（文学 绘画 艺术）</p></blockquote><p>Chill Hits. Chill Tracks. Chillin’ on a Dirt Road. Chill Vibes. Evening Chill. Chill as Folk. Pop Chillout. </p><p>Interestingly, as a musical ethos, chill has also eked its way onto the pop charts: SoundCloud rap, one of the most popular and lucrative genres of the decade, is marked by distortion, low fidelity, and a slurred vocal delivery that seems plainly indebted to anti-anxiety medication.</p><blockquote><p>ethos 理念<br>eke 增加；勉强维持<br>lucrative 赚钱的<br>distortion 扭曲变形<br>slurred 发音不清<br>indebted 欠…</p></blockquote><p>SoundCloud rap is hardly as limp or as purposefully benign as Chillhop’s study music, but the genres do share a sort of practiced nonchalance, a heavy dedication to chill.</p><blockquote><p>limp 柔软的<br>nonchalance 冷漠的</p></blockquote><p>Although I recognize the utility of listening to non-distracting study music, I nonetheless find it disheartening to see art being reconfigured, over and over again, as a tool for productivity—and then, when the work is finally done, as a tool for coming down from the work.</p><blockquote><p>disheartening 令人沮丧的</p></blockquote><p>It’s especially disconcerting to see the practice of active listening denigrated, dismissed, or ignored.</p><blockquote><p>disconcerting 令人不安的<br>denigrate 诋毁</p></blockquote><p>Background music is hardly a new development, but, previously, these sorts of experiences were mostly relegated to elevators and waiting rooms; now the groundless consumption of music has become omnipresent. </p><blockquote><p>be relegated to 被分配为<br>groundless 无理由地<br>omnipresent 无所不在的</p></blockquote><p>In a 2015 press release, Spotify declared itself “obsessed with figuring out how to bring music into every part of your life, wherever you are, whatever you’re doing, whatever your mood.”</p><blockquote><p>obsess 沉迷于</p></blockquote><p>The idea of purposeful listening—which is to say, merely listening—is becoming increasingly discordant with the way that music is sold to us.</p><blockquote><p>be discordant with 与…不一致 </p></blockquote><p>The German philosopher Josef Pieper, in his signal essay “Leisure: The Basis of Culture,” from 1952, quotes the poet and critic Charles Baudelaire: “One must work, if not from taste then at least from despair. For, to reduce everything to a single truth: work is less boring than pleasure.” </p><p>Pieper argues that Westerners in spiritual decline can’t “acquiesce to being,” but, instead, must “overwork as a means of self-escape, as a way of trying to justify our existence.”</p><blockquote><p>acquiesce 接受</p></blockquote><p>It makes sense that, in 2019, as we grow collectively more uncomfortable with our own quiet, inefficient sentience, we have also come to neglect the more contemplative pursuits, including mindful listening, listening for pleasure, listening to be challenged, and even listening to have a very good time while doing nothing else at all.</p><blockquote><p>sentience 感知能力<br>contemplative 深思的</p></blockquote>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a id="more"></a><h1 id="楔子"><a href="#楔子" class="headerlink" title="楔子"></a>楔子</h1><p>这份举国默哀的通知来的很突兀，却也很理所当然。对于逝者，这是一份值得的尊重；对于生者，这也是一道该有的仪式。</p><h1 id="一"><a href="#一" class="headerlink" title="一"></a>一</h1><p>我是元月一号离开武汉的。原本打算是在武汉实习到过年才离开。这么早离开武汉，也是因缘际会：表姐要订婚，有人告知我武汉或许会有传染病。后来经过社交圈子的重合反推，大抵上，我也是间接受过李文亮恩泽。可让我去缅怀悼念他，我也和他素未谋面，网路上的谋面也未曾有过，消息的传达是经过二手六眼。</p><p>可是我的确是受了他的恩泽的，他离去的那一夜我也彻夜未能眠，那天晚上网路上各种消息的混杂，抢救的否定之否定，逝世消息的散播否定再散播，都像给这位先生披上了一层面纱，一层我看不清的面纱。</p><p>我曾称他为神父，原谅我使用了一个过于浪漫且有歧义的比喻，但他确实像个神父。他在朦胧中看到了似乎的真相，并慷慨的向众人传播。但他不是神，他不是呼吸科的专家，他看病毒也是雾中看花；他也不是众生，他是一个大方善良的人。尽管很多人似乎将他比喻为架在十字架上的耶稣，但其实并没有那么严重，但他是个神父，他听到了朦胧启示，他向众人传播；当然不那么正规的传教是会收到一些警告，甚至他没保全住自己的样子，也像个神父。</p><p>受汝恩泽，继汝遗德；或许未来我也没有机会成为神，但是做个勇敢点的神父，大抵还是有机会的。</p><h1 id="二"><a href="#二" class="headerlink" title="二"></a>二</h1><p>我是不忍心看微博求援话题里灭门破家的或真或假的惨剧的，那是惨剧，并不是拥有艺术意义的悲剧。“悲剧是把美好的事物撕裂给观众看。”，尽管我不忍心看，我也多少耳闻目睹了一些惨剧，但在这其中，我是看不到美好，只是看到失序下人们的倾轧和挣扎，彷徨与失措。自一月廿二日起的自上至下，都是一种失序的丑态。</p><p>论上，是往常高高在上的人，自廿二日起，失去了他的领导力，往常如臂指使的下，而今却重若泰山，在背负如此之重之后，上的人举步维艰。而下的惨状，何须多言。失序，一切都在失序。医院跳脱出秩序向外求援，而最后承受失序责任的竟然也是医院。我的系主任发过一片调查报告——《大怡之后，谁做医生》，报告内容自然是湮灭在互联网墓园中，成为了一片被消去的记忆。看到那些过劳死的名单，我麻木地问自己，这一切值得吗？大抵是不值得的，我向来惜命惜身不忍病痛。但易地而处要我去做逃兵，那我也不至于如此无耻。</p><p>我原本在高考后考虑过去做医生，认为这是一个按部就班稳定一生的好活计，抱歉了，我以前有如此想法；这是一个始终在战斗的职业，尤其是在国情面前医生待遇远低于发达国家。辛苦了，或说安息久睡。</p><h1 id="三"><a href="#三" class="headerlink" title="三"></a>三</h1><p>最后祭奠一下互联网的记忆。我嘲笑互联网若有类似代表性家庭的代表性网民，那人定是鱼头两脚羊。两脚羊不必多说，鱼头揶揄记忆只有七秒。这件事或许真的过了今天就过去了，很多创伤的确在不久之后就被人遗忘的一干二净，但总有些二手时间，得留给我，去回忆，去反思，去感恩，去敬佩。</p>]]></content>
